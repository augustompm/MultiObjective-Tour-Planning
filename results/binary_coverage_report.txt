Binary Coverage Calculation Report
=================================

Implementation following:
1. 'Performance Assessment of Multiobjective Optimizers' (Zitzler et al., 2003)
2. 'Evolutionary algorithms for solving multi-objective problems' (Coello et al., 2007)

Binary Coverage Definition:
-------------------------
The binary coverage metric C(A,B) measures the fraction of solutions in set B
that are weakly dominated by at least one solution in set A.

Interpretation:
- C(A,B) = 1 means that all solutions in B are weakly dominated by solutions in A
- C(A,B) = 0 means that no solution in B is weakly dominated by any solution in A
- In general, higher values of C(A,B) indicate that A is better than B
- Note that C(A,B) and C(B,A) should be considered together for a complete comparison

Summary Table:
Algorithm A | Algorithm B | C(A,B) | Interpretation
-----------|------------|---------|---------------
NSGA-II     | MOVNS      | 0.1800 | NSGA-II weakly dominates some solutions of MOVNS
MOVNS       | NSGA-II    | 0.3243 | MOVNS slightly dominates NSGA-II


Detailed Results:
----------------
C(NSGA-II, MOVNS) = 0.1800
- NSGA-II: 74 non-dominated solutions
- MOVNS: 50 non-dominated solutions
- 18.00% of MOVNS's solutions are weakly dominated by at least one solution from NSGA-II

C(MOVNS, NSGA-II) = 0.3243
- MOVNS: 50 non-dominated solutions
- NSGA-II: 74 non-dominated solutions
- 32.43% of NSGA-II's solutions are weakly dominated by at least one solution from MOVNS
