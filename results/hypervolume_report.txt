Hypervolume Calculation Report
============================

Implementation following:
1. 'A Faster Algorithm for Calculating Hypervolume' (While et al., 2006)
2. 'Performance Assessment of Multiobjective Optimizers' (Zitzler et al., 2003)
3. 'Adjusting normalization bounds to improve hypervolume' (Wang et al., 2023)

Problem-specific constants used for normalization:
- Ideal point: [0.0, 60.0, 10.0, 10.0]
- Nadir point: [500.0, 840.0, 1.0, 1.0]

Reference point: [550.0, 924.0000000000001, -0.9, -0.9]
(Note: For maximization objectives, values are stored as negated values)

Hypervolume Interpretation:
-------------------------
The hypervolume indicator measures the volume of the objective space that is dominated
by the Pareto front approximation and bounded by the reference point. As described in
Zitzler et al. (2003), p.125, it is 'the only unary indicator we are aware of that is capable
of detecting that A is not worse than B for all pairs (A,B).'

The normalized hypervolume scales this value to a range closer to [0,1], where:
  - 0 represents the worst possible performance
  - 1 represents a theoretically ideal performance

Higher hypervolume values indicate better approximation sets, capturing both
convergence to the true Pareto front and diversity of solutions.
